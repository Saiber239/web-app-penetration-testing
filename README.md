# 🛡️ Web Application Penetration Testing

## 🔍 Overview
This project demonstrates practical web application penetration testing techniques using **OWASP Juice Shop**, **DVWA**, and other intentionally vulnerable web applications. The goal is to identify, exploit, and document common web application vulnerabilities following the **OWASP Top 10**.

---

## ⚔️ Attacks Performed
| Vulnerability | Description                     | Status |
|---------------|---------------------------------|--------|
| SQL Injection (SQLi) | Extracted sensitive data by bypassing login forms | ✅ |
| Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) | Injected malicious JavaScript into user input | ✅ |
| Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) | Performed unauthorized actions on behalf of users | ✅ |
| Broken Authentication | Exploited weak session management | ✅ |
| Security Misconfigurations | Identified improper server settings | ✅ |

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- ⚡ **Burp Suite**
- ⚡ **OWASP ZAP**
- ⚡ **Nikto**
- ⚡ **SQLMap**
- ⚡ **Postman** (for API testing)
- ⚡ **Nmap**
- ⚡ **Firefox Developer Tools**

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the vulnerable application (example: OWASP Juice Shop):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop.git
    cd juice-shop
    npm install
    npm start
    ```
Access the application via http://localhost:3000

Use tools like Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP to intercept and analyze requests

Perform the necessary penetration testing attacks as per the OWASP Top 10

📑 Findings and Reports

The following table outlines the vulnerabilities found during testing:

Vulnerability

Exploited Feature

Impact

Mitigation Recommendations

SQL Injection (SQLi)

Login Form

High

Use prepared statements, input validation

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

Comment Section

Medium

Implement output encoding, CSP headers

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Account Settings

High

Implement CSRF tokens, same-site cookies

Broken Authentication

Login Session

Critical

Use secure session management, multi-factor authentication

Security Misconfigurations

Server Headers

Medium

Remove unnecessary headers, configure security settings properly

🔒 Best Practices for Secure Web Applications

To protect against common vulnerabilities, follow these security measures:

✅ Use HTTPS to encrypt traffic

✅ Implement strong authentication (MFA, secure password storage)

✅ Perform input validation to prevent SQLi and XSS attacks

✅ Set up proper access controls to prevent unauthorized access

✅ Regularly update dependencies to patch security flaws

📌 Future Improvements

Enhance API security testing with Postman and Burp Suite API scanning

Automate security scans using Nikto and OWASP ZAP scripting

Implement Real-Time Monitoring using SIEM solutions

Explore container security and hardening for deployments

📢 Conclusion

This project provided hands-on experience with web application penetration testing techniques. By exploiting vulnerabilities and documenting findings, we can better understand how to secure modern web applications. Future work will focus on advanced attack vectors, automation, and integrating security best practices into the DevSecOps pipeline.
